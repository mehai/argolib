# How to contribute
If you want to contribute to this project, please read the following lines:
 - We work only with __ISSUES__. If you are new, please follow the issues tab and try to find an appropriate issue for beginners.
 - Before you start to work on an issue, please make your intention clear on the issue discussion section and wait for the issue
 to be assigned to you. It might be possible to have a small discussion with the administrator of the project before being assigned
 to a certain issue.
 - You can work on an issue __ONLY AFTER IT WAS ASSIGNED TO YOU__
 - __ALL THE WORK IS BEING DONE ON SEPARATE BRANCHES FOR EVERY ISSUE__
 - __Be respectful with the rest of the community__. Not respecting this simple constraint will result in you being kicked out of the
 community.
 - Please also read the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
